This project involved conducting a comprehensive Exploratory Data
Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing financial and demographic
attributes of loan applicants. The goal was to identify key factors
influencing loan defaults and develop risk mitigation strategies for
lending institutions.
Key Contributions:
• Performed data cleaning and pre-processing to handle missing values
and inconsistencies.
• Conducted statistical analysis and visualized trends using Python
(Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
• Identified correlations between applicant attributes and loan default
risks.
• Derived insights to assist in optimizing credit approval strategies.
Tools & Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn,
Google Colab.
